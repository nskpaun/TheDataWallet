# The Data Wallet

People are learing their private data is valuable.

For a long time there has been a hidden contract between people using free internet services and the companies building those services. People can use the service for free in exchange for the rights to their private data. This includes things like your social media posts, your browser history, even down to how much time you spend looking at something.

Some of the most profitable companies in the world are able to drive those profits by using your private data. Without the use of that data, those companies would be less profitable. One popular narrative is that these companies are "selling your data to advertisers". Therefore your data should have some monetary value. This begs a few questions:

* Precisely how valuable is my private data?
* Am I getting an objectively fair deal when I exchange my private data for the ability to use an internet service?
* How can I prevent my data from being taken from me unfairly?

With commodities like oil these questions are fairly easy to answer because there is a transparent and competitive market for oil. We can't treat data exactly like oil because it can be copied and shared, but we can consider the utility of the data. This leads us to our motivating question: **What would it look like for you to own your data and have the ability to sell its utility on an open market?**
